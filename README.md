# xrp-multi-pay

This web app allows a user to send XRP payments to multiple recipients. The user uploads a CSV file with the recipients' addresses and amounts, and the app sends the payments after the user transfers the necessary XRP to the app's address using the Xumm app.

This is a Work-in-Progress. The app is currently under construction, with app architecture and implementation planning under way.

The app has a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.
